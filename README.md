## Overview


## 1. 🎯 Zero-Shot Object Detection Kit

A Unity plugin that enables real-world object detection in XR using Microsoft Florence-2 on Meta Quest.
<br>
- Instantly detect objects in your environment with zero-shot AI (no training required)  
- Send image data from your Quest to the Florence API and receive rich detection \& description results  
- Fully integrated with Unity for easy setup and flexible use in XR workflows  


### ⚠️ Limitations


- **Not Real-Time:** API response times mean detection is fast but not instantaneous  
- **Requires Internet:** Wi-Fi needed to send images to the cloud API

## 2. 🤖 Custom AI Model Training Kit (Roboflow)

A Unity plugin that brings you custom-trained object detection to XR — powered by Roboflow and optimized for Meta Quest.
<br>
- Upload and annotate your own image datasets (capturing directly on Meta Quest recommended)  
- Run models locally on-device for faster inference and offline use  
- Fully integrate detection results into your Unity XR app  


### ⚠️ Limitations

- **Setup Time:** Requires effort to collect, annotate, and train datasets  
- **CUDA & Docker Setup Needed:** See [Roboflow’s repo](https://github.com/roboflow/inference)
