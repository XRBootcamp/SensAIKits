\## Overview



\## 1. 🎯 Zero-Shot Object Detection Kit



A Unity plugin that enables real-world object detection in XR using Microsoft Florence-2 on Meta Quest.



\- Instantly detect objects in your environment with zero-shot AI (no training required)  

\- Send image data from your Quest to the Florence API and receive rich detection \& description results  

\- Fully integrated with Unity for easy setup and flexible use in XR workflows  



\### ⚠️ Limitations



\- \*\*Not Real-Time:\*\* API response times mean detection is fast but not instantaneous  

\- \*\*Requires Internet:\*\* Wi-Fi needed to send images to the cloud API  



\## 2. 🤖 Custom AI Model Training Kit (Roboflow)



A Unity plugin that brings you custom-trained object detection to XR — powered by Roboflow and optimized for Meta Quest.



\- Upload and annotate your own image datasets (capturing directly on Meta Quest recommended)  

\- Run models locally on-device for faster inference and offline use  

\- Fully integrate detection results into your Unity XR app  



\### ⚠️ Limitations



\- \*\*Setup Time:\*\* Requires effort to collect, annotate, and train datasets  

\- \*\*CUDA \& Docker Setup Needed:\*\* See Roboflow’s repo \[here](https://github.com/roboflow/inference)
